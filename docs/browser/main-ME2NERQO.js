the scriptures he gave during the meeting, and gradually I began to notice that I know things before they happen. While I was fellowshipping with the Lord, it was as if I was in a court where they were talking about a Lady I knew, so when I woke up I felt like talking to her and telling her the exact thing I heard. I took a leap of faith and called her, I described what was said and she broke into tears because that was exactly what was going on in her life which was leading to her attempting to commit suicide. Another lady told me about her cousin who had been under demonic attacks, at times it was as if they wanted to take her life. I told her to give me the childs name by faith, so I prayed and practised what you said about exercising our spirit man. While I was praying I saw myself in the hospital and I prayed for the child. Since then the child started to amend, this is an illness that they have done a lot of things to treat but all to no avail. But after the prayers, they discharged them and said they could not find anything wrong.",name:"Bro V"},{information:"Last year Apostle (i.e. Miracle Ayo), called those who were involved in Media out, instructing that we should pay attention because there is a financial breakthrough coming from that place. I held onto that word and other words he gave me regarding handling foreign occurrences. From that time the Holy Spirit instructed me particularly that I should pay attention to that unction that came with word. During that time I came across some of the messages Apostle Babs preached, when he said if intercessors will keep their gates, they will hit traffic and that will be financial traffic, I kept that word. When I went to school at Lafiya, the only thing that was left with me was my bag, and no money to pay my school fees, although Apostle (I.e Miracle Ayo) said he was going to support me, I was still wondering how things would work out for me. Others started supporting me. Any time I pray and feel the unction of the Lord I will begin to declare a financial breakthrough over my life. Towards December I started to look for ways to grow one of my YouTube channels, so somebody advised me to create content which I did, immediately I put it online the channel just started growing, and the speed was so unusual. There is also another word Apostle (i.e. Miracle Ayo) gave me before I left for school, he said God will enable me to break the limit, and he said the Lord was giving me Hinds feet. I took that particular message and cut the session he prayed for me. I played it every day and made it my ringing tone. I wrote out my goal for the year and planned out what I would do with one million, and I wrote them out. My YouTube channel got monetized a few days after I wrote my plan, usually when your channel gets monetized, it becomes more hard to grow but that was not true in my case. People kept telling me that but I refused to believe it and the more I did that, the more the views and subscribers increased. Coming towards March I began to hear harvest in my spirit, I also spoke to others about it and what we have made this month in dollars is more than what we had made in other months.",name:"Bro I"},{information:"I studied Nursing and Midwifery at Saints Luke's Teaching Hospital and in 2023, while I finished serving, the struggles for getting a job were really not easy for me. In particular places I had to send applications more than once, I have spoken to some persons that I felt would help me, and at some points, they turned me down and started to ignore my calls. I remember when I came to New Wine, I was discussing something else with Apostle Miracle Ayo and he just gave a word that I was going to get a job. I held unto that word and knew it was real and a done matter. In November last year, I was called for an online interview at one of the places I applied for a job in Abuja, and a few days later they said I had to come for a physical interview which I did and they promised to contact me, which they never did. In early December someone I knew through my Dad had a medical facility so I spoke with him and that's how I started working with him. A few months I got a call from my Dad that my employment later was here in Zaria. I received that call on Friday and rushed down to Zaria on Monday.
